# Electrochemistry Plotting GUI

This will contain the code for the GUI I will use to make all of my plots. I'm working to build on what I have in my electrochemistryPlotting repository. Ideally, I can use the programs found in electrochemistryPlotting repo for one-off calculations and quick plots. This will be used for a more refined experience and to pass on to others in the lab. Both repos will contain most of the same functions, but serve different purposes.
